The context is very important. For example, reading an abstract description about laundries. Draw understandings from external experiences.


## Strategy: Preview-Question-Paraphrase
**Previewing** can be helpful. Go through the titles, chapters, outlines, bold words (terms,) diagrams, etc. before reading in detail. Just skimming gives you a sense of what this thing is about. That also help if you just preview the test/readin before going to a class. That's not exactly "reading." What about novels and other non-divided writings? Try taking a look at the first sentences of each paragraph.

**Questioning**: not reading yet but more in-depth than previewing. Gives you a *motivation* to read. You'll be trying to accomplish something rather than just reading. Write these down and check after the reading. These questions can make a great practice sheet. 

Spend five minutes on these two tasks and profit.

**Paraphrasing** while you actually read: for each paragraph, come up with a brief summary and connection to previous paragraphs(and writing it down, potentially.) Paraphrasing can help improve *durable* memory. The active effort can help you stay focus and save time re-reading. Do things right "the first time." (E.g., get the COMP 302 OCaml assignments right in the first attempt with type-checking and unit tests.) For math theorems, consider: how could this theorem/lemma/proposition apply to problems and make a difference?

The goal is to concentrate and focus on the content. Decide on whether subvocalization works for you for this particular text.

Idea: take the Jeopardy approach. What does this paragraph answers?

Note that that's different from re-reading in the sense that you have a different goal for each reading.

Also: take a 20-second break every 20 minutes. Give yourself time to "forget". Take the time for breaks and clear your head. If you find the content challenging, that you are likely makinog progress. If you put in the work and it's still challenging, it might be the time to reach out to the faculties for help.

## The SQ3R strategy
In this strategy, **recite** after reading. Try to recall what the reading was about. That extra layer of task could help enhance the impression.

**Note.** Connecting new concepts to what you are familiar with can help improve understandings.

## Tips
### Use questioning
Ask questions on the reading. Also, ask the instructors and your peers if you aren't sure about some concept.

### Manage your time
Know how much time these would take. Schedule prudently. Start reviewing early, so that instead of cramming, what you learned would stick.

### Take effective notes
Paraphrase, not copying everything. However, if you need to and publish using your notes, be sure that you keep track the sources.

### Get sleep
Take between 7 and 9 1/2 hours of sleep every night. That helps the brain consolidate the memories and enhance durable memories. You are better off sleeping rather than staying up studying.

### Mind your environment
Find a space that is comfortable for you. Don't do your work in you bed (Alexnder Liepins mentioned this so many times in the two webinars.) Find a dedicated corner for studying- only.

### Know yourself
Know how you learn, your motivators (e.g., getting good grade, Honor Roll, etc.)

## McGill TLS resources
Take a look at the Learning with Zoom resources.

Doyle and Zakrjsek: New scince of learning: How to learn in harmony with your brain. Herdon: Stylus Publishing.

For literature readings: know the goals of the literature course and pay special attentions to these fields during your reading. Also: take a look at McGill's Library guides. Check out McGill's courses on writing.

Take two weeks to practice these strategies in the wild.
