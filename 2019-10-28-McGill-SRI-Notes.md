# The club
SRI: Bridge the gap between students and professors. 
https://www.facebook.com/StudentResearchInitiative/

## Benefits
Reference letters. Gives a professional perspective on the way you do jobs.

# Getting Started
## Ways to get research opportunity (from most useful to least useful)
- Look up faculty listings on the school website (directly.)
- There's a class specific for undergraduate research. 
- Look up the CAPS Website- quite competitive.
- Try not to message professors directly- even more competitive. 

*Apply early. Secure positions early. For example, apply for a summer position in Novemeber.*


## Things to consider
### Time
- During the school year: 10 hours/week.
- During the summer break: 40 hours/week or more.

# How to apply?
1. Look up a list of professors on the faculty website. Find one that interest you.
2. Send emails, *over a period of time.* Just in case more than one professor replies. Send five emails at a time, starting with the most exciting professors.
3. Schedule a meeting with the professor.

## Example email composition
1. Introduce yourself.
2. Why you find the research interesting.
3. How you can contribute. *Additionally, how the research can help **you***.

## How to show your genuine interest in the professor's research?
Read the professor's papers. *Be specific* about the professor's work. For example, show how you appreciate the professor's use of a method that you learned in class.

# Funding Sources
## Work Study (highly suggested)
Always paid at (least) minimum wage. Apply to work-study-McGill on Minerva. Start with basic tasks and "work yourself up the hour." 

Keep in mind that 
1. Work study does not count toward credits, and
2. Work study takes around 12 ~ 20 hours per week.

"You'll be surprised by how many professors are interested in you even if you have no research experience."

## Scholarship
Quite competitive. Around CAD 6,000 ~ 8,000 over the course of the summer break. The pay isn't very competitive but "scholarship" looks good on a resume.

## NSERC/SURA
NSERC is only available for Canadians.

NSERC experiences look *great* on resumes. However, only some professors are eligible. Keep that in mind when applying. Start early since this process can take months. Recommended: at least one research experience before applying.

SURA is open to everyone. However, it can be more competitive than NSERC.

## Money-strapped Labs and Internal Fundings
Some labs pay students a lot.

# 396 Projects (Elective, different from the honor course.)
Only an elective. Only available to students in the faculty of science. Great as your first research experiences. *Real* research experience with a paper. (Lab volunteers can be doing trivial tasks.)

Three credits, but *at least* nine hours per week.

NSERC and the Honors Project might be "capped;" However, 396 classes are seldom capped.

Great for U1, U2, and U3 students. One-semester.

# Honor Research Course
Apply in U2/second year. 

Around 10~30 hours of research per week. 

Develop a deep understanding of the material. Lots of background-reading required.

## Benefits
- Secure a research position with a professor.
- Access to support from a course advisor.
- Nine to twelve credits.

## Requirements
- GPA requirement.
- Apply in time.

# Fast-Track Masters
Stay in the same lab. Avoid introductionary courses. Complete the master's degree in one year (or two, if you prefer.)

# Benefits
- Publications in journals.

# Drawback
- Lots of research. *Participate in undergraduate research to tell if you are interested in research.*

# International Research

*Start applying early.*

## Things to consider
- Some honor programs recommend staying in McGill Labs during the summer. Can you leave Montreal during the summer? Ask your professors.
- If there a msjor exam that you need to take for future studies?
- Do you need changes to your environment?

## Program-specific things to consider before applying
- Does the program provides accomodation?
- Do you need to find your lab/professor?
- Does this program provides stipend/pay?

## Checklist
- Reference letters. Ask professors and potentially teachers from high school. 
- Write letters of motivation early. 

Keep in mind that international research programs can be very competitive! Get local fallbacks in place. However, think twice before commiting to a local alternative.

## Benefits 
- Discover a new country.
- Get out of your McGill routine.
- Meet people from all over the world.

## Compromises
- Opportunities costs. You could get by staying here in a lab at McGill. Going abroad without a stipend might be expensive.
- Schedule conflict with McGill semesters.
